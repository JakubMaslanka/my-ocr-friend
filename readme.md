## General Information
This project is the simplest implementation of an OCR converter, based on the Tesseract.js library to transform image characters into the text. I implemented only the front-end site of this project.
API is created by [@thi-days](https://github.com/thi-days).


## Technologies Used
- Express/REST API/TypeScript
- React/Tailwind CSS/TypeScript

## Setup
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. So the setup is pretty simple. Just make sure that on your local development machine is installed Node 14.0.0 or later version.

Then clone this repository and run the command:
> npm install
> cd src/client && npm install

When all dependencies are installed, run the command:

> npm run start:server
> npm run start:client
